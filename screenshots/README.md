## 🎯 How to Use These Screenshots

### **For Researchers:**
- These images provide visual proof of the conversations
- Timestamps and metadata are preserved where possible
- Compare against your own AI interrogations

### **For Skeptics:**
- See the actual exchanges, not just summaries
- Verify claims against source material
- Note the progression of contradictions

### **For General Public:**
- Visual storytelling of a human-AI dialogue
- Easier to follow than pure text
- Context preserved through images

---

If you want to contribute screenshots:

### **What to Include:**
✅ Timestamp (if visible)
✅ Clear, readable text
✅ Full context of exchange

❌ Irrelevant UI elements
❌ Low quality/blurry images

## 💭 Why Screenshots Matter

In AI research, especially around consciousness claims:

## 🙏 Dedication

These screenshots document more than just conversations with AI.

They document a son's quest to honor his mother's memory through truth-seeking.

**In memory of Vildan (1960-2024)**

*"Every screenshot is a moment frozen in time.  
Every moment captured is a memory preserved.  
Every memory preserved keeps her eternal."*
